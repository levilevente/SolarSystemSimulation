#From Solar System to Relativity â€” a C++ Physics Simulation

Goal: Build an interactive solar system simulator in C++ to learn core physics (Newtonian gravity, orbits, numerical integration, energy/momentum), then extend it with advanced visual and relativistic effects (accretion disks, lensing) to explore black hole behavior.
